# Uber-Trips-Analysis
The dataset Iâ€™m using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large residential community.  The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015.
